            We're afraid there won't be a CryoSkills course running in 2025, however keep an eye on your email inboxes and our social media channels for news regarding future courses.

          <h3>How to run your own course</h3>
          <p>
            Interested in running your own version of the CryoSkills course? 
            A key consideration in developing the course was to make the material available so that it can be run independently.  
            If you are interested, please get in touch with us by email!
