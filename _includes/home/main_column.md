# CryoSkills 2024 - Thank you!
That's a wrap on the inaugural CryoSkills course, thanks to all the participants, organisers, administration, logistics and accommodation staff that made it possible.

We had a fantastic time in Norway - **watch this space** for a follow-up blog and release of the course materials if you want to try it out at home!
